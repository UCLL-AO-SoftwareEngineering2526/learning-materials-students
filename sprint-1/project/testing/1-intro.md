# Intro

The backend code you've received was written by a particularly undisciplined developer
who wrote no tests and introduced some bugs. You'll have to improve the robustness of
the application by introducing tests to ensure that these bugs don't resurface and you
don't introduce any new ones.

Different teams often interpret software testing terminology in varying ways, leading
to misunderstandings and misaligned expectations. For example, one team might define
"integration testing" as testing interactions between modules within a single application,
while another might see it as testing across multiple systems.

It is important for this course that you know what *we* mean when we're asking for a
particular test type. To help clear up any confusion, we've added a short description
of our expectations for every type of test.
