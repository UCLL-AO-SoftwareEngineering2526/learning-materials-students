# Create repository

## 1. Acceptance Criteria

At the end of this task you should have a repository in which you and your team can work on the backend.

The repository will be pre-populated with a backend written in Java with Spring Boot.

## 2. Implementation Details

1. Accept the GitHub classroom "dummy" assignment if you haven't already (see Toledo) and
   join the group "Iedereen". This is a workaround to make sure you are a member of the
   `UCLL-AO-SoftwareEngineering2526` organization. This is necessary so that Azure has
   access to your repositories.
1. Accept the GitHub classroom assignment for the backend (see Toledo)
1. Clone the repository to your computer
